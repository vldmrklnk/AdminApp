Goal of the application.
To automate everyday work of an administrator at a service station.
Application functionality.
The only user of the application should be the administrator of the service station.
That user serves two client types: new clients and returning clients. Clients specify
their name and surname to the administrator to register an order. The
administrator should check whether the client is registered in the client base or
not.
It should be possible to open a client card with personal data (see the description
below) for existing users. Each client card has the following information about
related cars:
• Make
• Model
• Year
• VIN
The administrator can edit the list of cars for the client: add, edit or delete
(deletion is only possible if there are no orders related to the car).
It should also be possible to see the list of orders per each car. Each order
contains the following information:
• Date
• Order Amount (US$ 0,0 – 10,000)
• Order Status (Completed / In Progress / Cancelled)
The administrator can edit the list of orders for the car: add, edit or delete.
It should be possible to create a client card for new clients who haven’t been
registered in the application before. This card should have the following
parameters:
• First Name
• Last Name
• Date of Birth
• Address
• Phone
• Email
